# Introduction {-}

Lewis & Clark was able to acquire a high performance computing cluster during the summer of 2017, as a result of Greta Binford's capital equipment request. The cluster is a smaller version of the cluster used at Oregon State University's [Center for genome Research and Biocomputing](http://cgrb.oregonstate.edu/).
